- To access the global settings, open the settings above, then navigate to `Global Settings` within that dialog.


### Installation:

- Download and install The Sims 4 Community Library (link in the Requirements section)
- Download this mod
- Unpack the this mods archive and drop the files from it into your The Sims 4 folder (...\The Sims 4\)
- Enjoy


## Quirks:

- Changing the gender or gender options of Sims globally will not update the Clothing they are wearing.
  - Beware! You may encounter Male Sims wearing female clothing or Female Sims wearing male clothing.
- All settings are available for all Sims, but not all settings will be apparent until the Sim becomes a Teen or Adult.
  - The Gender, Toggle Breasts, Body Frame, Pregnancy Option, and Clothing Preference settings will not visually or functionally change anything for Child or Toddler Sims until they become Teens.
  - The Toilet Usage setting will change the animation a Child Sim plays when using a toilet (Standing vs Sitting) and the Gender setting will only have an effect on the voice of a Child or Toddler Sim.
