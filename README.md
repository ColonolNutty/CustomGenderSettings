  - Access the settings SHIFT+CLICK on a Sim -> Configure Mod Settings -> Custom Gender Settings
- To access the global settings, open the settings above, then navigate to `Global Settings` within that dialog.

- Download this mod
- Unpack the this mods archive and drop the files from it into your Mods folder (...\The Sims 4\Mods\)
- Enjoy


## Quirks:

- Changing the gender or gender options of Sims globally will not update the Clothing they are wearing.
  - Beware! You may encounter Male Sims wearing female clothing or Female Sims wearing male clothing.
- All settings are available for all Sims, but not all settings will be apparent until the Sim becomes a Teen or Adult.
  - The Gender, Toggle Breasts, Body Frame, Pregnancy Option, and Clothing Preference settings will not visually or functionally change anything for Child or Toddler Sims until they become Teens.
  - The Toilet Usage setting will change the animation a Child Sim plays when using a toilet (Standing vs Sitting) and the Gender setting will only have an effect on the voice of a Child or Toddler Sim.
 

### Requirements:

- Sims 4 version 1.56.52.1020 (Realm of Magic) or above
- At least version 1.40 of [The Sims 4 Community Library](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary/releases/download/v1.40/sims4communitylib.v1.40.zip)
